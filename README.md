CUMULUS
=======

#Pitch

Cumulus is a calculating surface.

#Rationale

This is a UI exercise to see how a calculating surface would work and how to work on list items. It plays with the modern ways we have to edit and capture data. Usually it is a given that you should edit an online interface like that :

However would'nt it be better if you could edit your content on a flat interface in a desktop fashion? Why should we ever need the form interface? Cumulus aims at exploring this UI problem.

#Principle

Cumulus sums the figures you attach with a blurb of text in the input. The input is then just text + digits and Cmulus makes the calculation. Typically this is the kind of app you would use to track expenses. The data is saved in the localStorage to simulate a database.
